Sketch Plugin Manager
=====================

Sketch Plugin Manager uses the power of Git to keep all of your installed plugins up to date.

### Supported Operating Systems
Sketch Plugin Manager is currently only supported on **OS X 10.12 Seirra**. A build for 10.11 El Capitan is in the works. To get notified of changes, **watch** this [project on GitHub](https://github.com/mludowise/Sketch-Plugin-Manager).

Usage
-----

Open the plugin manager from the plugins menu.

### Catalog

Sketch Plugin Manager's Plugin Catalog connects to the [Sketch Plugin Directory](https://sketchapp.com/extensions/plugins/) to let you browse and install plugins available on GitHub.

### Installed Plugins

If you already installed plugins without using Sketch Plugin Manager or Git, they will need to be reinstalled from the Catalog in order to check for the latest updates. Go to the Installed tab to reinstall plugins.
